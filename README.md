# BACS-2025-Research-Proposal

Welcome! This repository hosts my honors-thesis-style proposal:

> **Price Discovery and Liquidity in Tokenized U.S. Equities:  
> A High-Frequency Microstructure Study**

In this project, I explore how newly launched on-chain equity tokens (Robinhood EU on Arbitrum, Dinari dShares on Base, Kraken xStocks) compare to their NASDAQ counterparts in terms of:

- **Tracking error & basis dynamics**  
- **Venue-level price-discovery leadership**  
- **Liquidity costs & trade-arrival contagion**

Using Bloomberg TAQ for traditional equities and blockchain/WebSocket feeds for tokens, I apply state-space filtering, rolling VECMs, and Hawkes-process econometrics to deliver the first peer-review-ready evidence on tokenized-equity market quality.
